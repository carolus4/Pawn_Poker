# Thinking about the problem:

This implementation has a fairly simple cycle:
for number_of_games:  
    {Bidding -> reveal}

## Strategies
I can think of only 3 layers (heh) of strategies to learn:  

1. Bid on hands based on expected win rate
2. Bluff! 
3. Out-play your opponent

The first strategy is reasonable, if playing against a random opponent. 

The second strategy requires playing a 'smart' opponent, e.g. in self-play.

The third strategy would be ideal (if possible). If I can predict the opponent's move, I can out-play them.

## Modelling

### Augment / Transform Input state
One opportunity is to compute directly the likelihood of winning for a hand, and feed that into the model. 
It would simplify the learning process significantly (since the input neuron dimension would just be 2 - win likelihood, and bet value). 
I think it's fair, based on some of the augmentation of state - e.g. [Mugit's spaceshooter](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/a3294ba2-569c-4bd8-9f71-3e584be7ee07/team_honey_mugit.py?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220819%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220819T060314Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=2f7dd8198bca067c691fecddea2c3765b6d20fb4430ec30590d256dd8d19a1b4&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22team_honey_mugit.py%22&x-id=GetObject)

`def augment(state):`  
`    # calculate angle between ships`  
`[...]`


### [ âœ“ ] Mask Output state
We know some actions are illegal, and should not be chosen. There is an implementation that can be selected for choose_move (or in training?)

### Check Submission 
After step 1, I am unsure if choose move will successfully return an action for every state.  
It *should* be OK, as I am only seeing errors when the state is 'done' - which shouldnt call 'act' - but this needs to be checked.

# Iterations on architectures:

## Step 1 - implement the very naive 
The Policy Gradient Algorithm from last time seems to 'learn' naively to play against a random opponent.

Iterations are much faster than in the previous game, so I tried running training over 100k episodes

To get this to run, I needed to implement the masking code.
I also am running across a number of issues with the game having no legal moves. This may be a problem in the actual submission - tbd!
